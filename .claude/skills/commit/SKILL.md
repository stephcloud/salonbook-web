# Commit

1. `git status` and `git diff --staged` (if nothing is staged, show the unstaged diff and ask what to include).
2. Warn if the diff contains secrets, `.env` content, stray `console.log`, or large unrelated changes.
3. Write a Conventional Commit message: `type(scope): short summary` (feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, style). Add a short body if the change is non-obvious.
4. Show the message and commit after the user approves.

Never push.
